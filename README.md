### Setmap jQuery plugin for Google Maps

This is very simple to use, but a powerful jQuery plugin for embedding maps.

You could embed a Google map with a single line:

  `$('#map').setmap();`

But you can also:

 * set initial location
 * set markers
 * easily subscribe to events via callbacks
 * change some map properties
 * set a ton of initial settings if you'd like to
 * use HTML5 Geolocation to set the map to the current location
 * use Geocoding - find coordinates from a string or from pointing on the map
 * use Reversed Geocoding - find exact adrress from coordinates or pointing on the map
 * use Google Maps Directions and render the directions instructions in a separate panel
 * and much more with the Google Maps API - the plugin expose the native objects if you want to play with them

The documentation and the demos are for version 1.0. The API of the plugin is not compatible with the previous version so use it only if you could retrieve the API from the source.

I will be updating the docs and the examples in the near future and they will be available at this address: http://hkdobrev.github.com/setmap
